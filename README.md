My Custom (as in the ones I use a bit) Wordlists


Web - tends to be for bruteforceing directorys and files with tools like gobuster, etc.
Recon - As above but with things that are more "interesting"
Auth - Username and Password lists - Likely to be quite small because of the large amount of quality lists elsewhere
